- JetsetRadio inspired girl (fighting with break dance moves, kicks off walls to jump or run)
- OngBak inspired
- Flamboyant prick
- character with telekinesis that controls a flying weapon (smug, cocksure, detached, minimum effort but visually clear)
- female bancho (https://twitter.com/HOOOOJICHA/status/1232693076344229888/photo/1)
- definitely a mexican inspired fighter with this kind of energy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZAkzCw17GM)
