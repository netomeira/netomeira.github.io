- Making online play not feel so lonely, make it have a sense of community and group improvement instead;
- Not afraid to be cheesy or colourful, and the announcer should be hype about things;
- Not use a minimalistic artstyle, that shit is shit and bland;
- Use GGPO;
- Make it easy to communicate and encourage making friends;
- Hits must sell impact, focus on strong keyposes and angle of the character at all times (avoid characters that fight slapping like Nina);
- Unreal Engine;
- Stages need to feel alive while not getting in the way of reading things, while telling cool stories between rounds;
- Make it unmecessary to check for things outside of the game like frame data;
- Clear visual communication for frame data (inspired on Soul Calibur break moves) or make it not very important by improving pushblock;
- Fight request from training mode;
- All play lobby (everyone plays at the same time)
- Gameplay separated from music (configurable playlist, showing the current song on the bottom right, have it loop on the stage)
