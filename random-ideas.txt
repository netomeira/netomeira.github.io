- Set in a city (could relate to the name of the game/maybe not, could limit the scope of stages);
- When rematching after a loss, special animation for your character getting up with some encouraging quote reacting to the victory 
    quote of the enemy (break this rule if the character is implied to kill the enemy, not sure yet what kind of tone would be cool)
- Random stage select should change the stage every match
- Character pick should be reversible up until the point the match starts
- Character select accessible from everywhere
- Controller setting should be tap to set and accessible on the character select screen
- Button check available on character select screen and settings
